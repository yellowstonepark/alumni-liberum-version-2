       <h3>How I contributed towards our Constitution:</h3>
        <p>For over 50 countless hours of hard work, I made this Constitution for my class. It is over 10,000 words, the one pasted below. To create this Constitution, I had to study for the actual Constitution, decifiering the language they used back then. I hope that this can show you how dedicated I am towards the class, and how much I am willing to work to improve the class, for both teachers and students.</p>
        <p>And if that doesn't prove dedication, I don't know what does.</p>

      <article class="The-Constitution">
          <h1>The Constitution of 8Genial1 <lb />
             (inspired by the US Constitution)</h1>

  <p>We the people of 8Genial1, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the class of 8Genial1.

    <hr />

  <h3>Article I</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>
  <p>All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of 8Genial1, in a unicameral legislature.</p>

  <h4>Section 2</h4>
  <p>If a Congressman/Congresswoman wants to be elected, they first must contact the election manager, Madame Arabachian, at aarabachain@schools.nyc.gov. The election manager will then proceed by putting those candidates on the ballot, and the political party that they associate themselves with. A person can only run for one position e.g. the president can only run for president, not a Congressman/Congresswoman at the same time. After the class’ votes are in, the way that the people are chosen is by the popular vote.

  <p>There will be 10 possible Congress members at once. If there is a tie in the vote, the Vice President will break the tie. If there are less than 10 people who want to be in Congress, then the governed will be randomly picked for the remaining Congress spots. Teachers can also apply for Congress spots, but there cannot be more than 3 teachers in Congress at once. Therefore, if more than 3 teachers apply for Congress, 3 will be randomly picked out of the teachers. The website that will be used for random picking will be wheelofnames.com.

  <p>Congressmen and Congresswomen will have a max of 3 terms. The first term that they serve will be 2 months long, and if they are elected to serve another term, that term will only be for a month. Finally, if they are elected one more time, that term will be 2 months long. Therefore, one can spend up to 5 months in Congress.

  <p>If in the middle of a term, a member of Congress breaks a law or is accused of Treason, Felony and/or Breach of the Peace, and is proven guilty in the Supreme Court of 8Genial1, then they will be immediately removed from office. Then the public is asked if they want to volunteer to be in that spot, and if a volunteer is found for the spot they will replace that member. If no members of the public volunteer, then a random person is picked. If there are many volunteers, then a random person is picked from those volunteers. The person removed from office will only be able to come back after a probationary period of 1 month. If the entire public is a probationary period, or if there are less than 10 people who are on the probationary period, then the public will be randomly selected to fulfill those (remaining) positions.

  <p>For a person to enter Congress, they must have to have at least 3 votes. Voters will be able to choose 5 candidates that they want for Congress on the Ballot. If there are less than 10 people with at least 3 votes, then people with 2 votes will be elected. If there are many candidates with 2 votes, they will be randomly selected. The process continues until all the seats of Congress are filled.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>The powers of the legislative branch are as follows.

  <p>The laws that the Legislative Branch makes not only apply to the governed, but also the people in the government. To pass a law, more than half of members of Congress must agree with the law. A law can be proposed by the general public in the weekly sessions of the Legislative Branch, for ten minutes on Fridays. During the Legislative Branch's weekly sessions, they will discuss the issues in the public at the current time, and possible laws they can make.

  <p>The Legislative Branch can also with 8/10 vote, override the Judicial Branch’s Ruling on certain cases. The Legislative Branch can only override the Judicial Branch’s Ruling on the punishment inflicted on the person, not whether they are guilty or not. The Legislative Branch cannot inflict punishment that is cruel and unusual and the Judicial Branch must approve the punishment. The Legislative Branch cannot use death penalty as a consequence. Possible acceptable punishments include but are not limited to: Calling the person’s parents, a probation period, and a ban from the Chat Section in Zooms. However, lowering a person’s grade is not an acceptable punishment. Ms. Arabachain is the only person who can handle grades.

  <p>The Legislative Branch can also impeach Judges and Justices, as well as the President. No one in the Legislative Branch can be impeached, but they can be removed from office (Has to be a ruling from the Supreme Court) temporarily on a probation period, but not permanently unless the time left in the year is less than 3½ months.

  <p>The impeachment process can be started with the Legislative Branch, the public, or the Executive Branch, but the Judicial Branch cannot start the process of impeachment under any circumstances.

  <p>The impeachment process is described in great detail in Article VII.

  <p>The Legislative Branch also has the ability to declare war on other classes.

  <p>The Legislative Branch will make the laws that Govern the People (check the law book on page 73), check the other branches, and the Branch has the ability to start impeachment trials.

<hr />

  <h3>Article II</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>
  <p>The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the class of 8Genial1. The President shall hold their Office during the Term of one month, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:

  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>If a President wants to be elected, they first must contact the election manager, Madame Arabachain, at aarabachain@schools.nyc.gov to let her know that they are running for President. Presidential candidates can start campaigning as soon as they like. They must find a vice president, their 3 cabinet members which they are allowed, and an idea of who they want for their supreme court nominees (if there are any) before their Presidential Debate. Candidates for President can have the same supreme court nominees. Those choices will be presented on the day of the Presidential Debate.

  <p>If the President cannot find a supreme court justice nominee, then the public will be randomly taken for the position. The nominee must know that they are elected as a nominee before they are announced as a nominee during the Presidential Debate.

  <p>Before the Presidential Debate, the candidate must submit to Ms. Arabachain their presidential poster (optional), their party name, information about their party (in 100 or less words), who their  vice president is, and who their cabinet members are (all will be on the ballot). If the person cannot come up with this information and send it to Ms. Arabachain more than 24 hours before the start time of the debate, then the person is considered disqualified and will not be on the ballot.

  <p>The Presidential Debate is to be held sometime from the 14th of the month to the 21st of the month. During this debate, the President will reveal their Vice President, and cabinet. The votes should be counted before the 23rd of the month, the day when the president is sworn (or affirmed) into office. If there is no school in session at the time, or any of the requirements cannot be met, due to holidays or for any other reason, Congress will vote on the date of the debate, and when the President will be affirmed. Each President will have a maximum of 2 terms.

  <p>Everyone in class 8Genial1 is expected (but not required) to vote for who they want the President to be. Their pick will be kept confidential between the election manager and the person. Furthermore, all teachers of the middle school of Russell Sage, in Forest Hills, NY are allowed to vote. Each vote will be equal in value and will be counted the same: i.e. everyone’s vote will be worth one vote, no matter if they are a student, teacher, or different genders or races. Bribing others to vote for you is highly illegal and will result in severe consequences from the supreme court.

  <p>Voting will be done through the platform forms.google.com. On this platform, voters will be able to see the political party of the candidate, their slogan, what their party stands for, and their poster (optional). Voters will have to write their name on the ballot and their  school email address for security purposes, but that information will not be considered when the vote is being counted. If the election manager becomes corrupt and participates in voter fraud, he/she will lose their position and Congress will vote on who should be in that position. The President will be chosen by the popular vote. If there’s a tie, then the previous Congress from the last candidate's term will decide the election. If it’s the first election, and a tie, then a Congress will be made first to decide the election from the votes counted. And if some of the candidates for Congress got a tie in their election, the results will be decided by random. If no one wants to be the President, the person will be chosen at random from the general public (anyone not running in the election).

  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>The Executive Branch’s main purpose is to be the leader of our class, and lead us into the days of tomorrow. The Executive Branch will consist of these 5 people, no more, no less: The President, His/Her chosen Vice President, and the President’s cabinet, consisting of 3 secretaries, one which is the head secretary for political purposes. Look at Article 6, Section 2 for an exception to the rule.

  <p>The powers of the Executive Branch are as follows:

  <p>The Executive Branch may Nominate Judges and Chief Justices to the Supreme Court

  <p>Declare Executive Order

  <p>Can Enforce Legislature

  <p>Can Make Proclamations

  <p>Can State Foreign Policy

  <p>Commander in Chief

  <p>Can Start the Amendment Process (at most 4 times per term)

  <p>Can Make Treaties

  <p>The President can Veto a Law Made by Congress

  <p>The President can only be overruled if the Vice President and the entire Cabinet disagree with a decision.

  <p>Before the President enters on the Execution of his Office, the person shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:- “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the Class of 8Genial1, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of our Class.”

<hr />

  <h3>Article III</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>
  <p>The judicial Power of the Class of 8Genial1, shall be vested in one supreme Court. The Judges shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Certain amount of Power, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>If a person wants to get the position of a Chief Justice or any Judge or the five Judges on the Supreme Court, they must be first nominated by the upcoming President of the Class of 8Genial1. Then Congress will vote on if the Justice shall be appointed. If there is a tie, the Vice President will decide the final vote. Congress shall decide which is to be the Chief Justice, not the President who elected the Justice. If there is a 2 way tie, the Vice President will choose, but if there is a 3 way, 4 way or 5 way tie, then the Chief Justice will be chosen at random from the people in the tie.


  <p>A Justice of the Supreme Court, that is not a Chief Justice, can have up to 3 terms, the first term being one month, the second term being 2 months, and the third term also being 2 months. A Chief Justice may only have 2 terms, with each being one month long. A Chief Justice may be appointed only after serving at least one term as a Justice of the Supreme Court, with the exception of the very first Chief Justice of the Class of 8Genial1 (so the President not first must pick someone who has already served in addition to other justices they appoint). However, the Chief Justice cannot be appointed if they have served more than 2 terms as a Justice of the Supreme Court. Therefore, one can serve up to 5 months on the Supreme Court.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>
  <p>The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the Class of 8Genial1, and Punishments made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all cases against a person of government, or cases from a person of government accusing a person of the public; to all cases where there is a dispute among the citizens over any matter; and to all cases where there is disagreement between the members of the government.


  <p>If for any reason, a Justice is suing any person, they are not entitled to vote during that case to determine punishment or if that person is guilty or innocent. Instead, the Chief Justice’s vote will count as two. That would be the only case where that would happen. If the Chief Justice is suing any person, they are also prohibited from voting in the court case, and if there is a tie in the vote, the vice president will break it. Court case hearings will be on Fridays, 10 minutes before Congress’s meeting.


  <p>The Judicial Branch has a multitude of powers, but is the only Branch which cannot start an amendment process. However the Judicial Branch is granted each of these powers, explained below:


  <p>Judicial Review: The Judicial Branch can review acts of Congress, and possibly disagree with it. To start the process of Judicial Review, at least ⅖ of the Justices must agree to start it. After the law is reviewed, a vote will settle if it will remain or be entered in our law book. If the vote is to see if the law is removed from the law book, the Chief Justice, and at least 2 other Justices must agree. If the vote is to see if the law is added to the law book, at least 3 Justices of any kind must agree.


  <p>The Judicial Branch will also be able to review acts of the President, making sure the President’s executive orders are constitutional.


  <p>Can Punish the Convicted: The Judicial Branch cannot inflict punishment that is cruel and unusual. The Branch cannot use death penalty as a consequence. Possible punishments include but are not limited to: Calling the person’s parents, a probation period from, and other punishments that do not hinder the person’s education are acceptable. However, lowering a person’s grade is not an acceptable punishment. Ms. Arabachain is the only person who can handle grades.


  <p>A court case can be gone over as many times as needed.


  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>The person being accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty.


  <p>Treason against the Class of 8Genial1, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.

<hr />

  <h3>Article IV</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>


  <p>If this plan does not work, and the central government becomes corrupt and abusive, then the people must rebel. The people can get the help of a forigen nation to help them overthrow and get rid of their government, so a new Constitution can be formed. During this time of forming a Constitution, the people will be expected to behave properly, even though there will be no rules.


  <p>If worst comes to worst, the Class of 8Genial1 need to give up their power for their own good, and return to their mother country, Ms. Arabachain, who has the strongest military in the world, and will protect us from forigen enemies and from ourselves.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>If another country declares War on our country, we must fight back to prevent being under another government. If the Class of 8Genial1 declares War on another country, we can take their government in a process called military conquest.


  <p>For Congress to declare war, more than half of Congress must agree to start the process.


  <p>If another country hacks the Zoom, and installs spies, then Congress will be advised to start a War.


  <p>In any case of war, the public must be drafted into the military, and the money from the treasury can be spent to get weapons, and other forms of protection equipment.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>War should only be started under these circumstances:


  <p>If the other country hacks (or attempts to hack) and continues to hack into our class Zooms, then we are allowed to start a War.


  <p>If the other country starts to bully kids from our class, then we are allowed to start a War.


  <p>War should not be started under these circumstances:

<ol>
  <li>Anger or disagreement between people in different countries</li>
  <li>The people of Congress thinking that it’s fun to have conflict</li>
</ol>

  <p>War should only be started under dire circumstances.

  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>Every 3 months, all the countries’ Presidents, and Vice Presidents will meet in a Zoom Conference call called the United Nations Call to discuss foriegn affairs, as well as disagreements. The Zoom call can be attended by the public, but they may not talk, or the country they are a part of will automatically become an enemy of ours.

<hr />

  <h3>Article V</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>
  <p>An Amendment to this Constitution can be made within the following rules:

  <p>Existing Amendments can only be changed if they are overridden by other amendments.

  <p>An Amendment cannot be made to fix a spelling or grammatical mistake, only large passages, or small passages that dramatically change the meaning of a particular section or any size passage that elaborates more on a unclear part.

  <p>If the Executive Branch proposes an amendment, if the entire Cabinet and the Vice President disagree, the Amendment cannot start to go through the process; it is voided.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>If the Executive Branch Proposed, The Amendment is to be approved by the Public and The Legislative Branch. If ⅔ of both agree on passing it, then the Amendment is passed. If ¾ of the Legislative Agrees, they can lower the Public Approvement needed from ⅔ to ½, and if all of the Legislative Branch Agrees, then it can lower the Public Approvement to ¼ . The same rules apply to the public; however, if 80% of the public agrees, the percentage of agreement required from the Legislative Branch Approvement drops to just ¼. The Public can OVERRULE anything the Legislative Branch states if they Get 92% APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>If The Public Proposed (at least 5 people need to say that they want the amendment changed), The Amendment is to be approved by the Legislative and Judicial Branch. To approve of the amendment, The Legislative Branch needs to give ⅔ Approvement, and the Judicial Branch needs the Chief Justice(if there is one in office) and 2 other justices. If there is no Chief Justice in office, then 4 of the 5 Justices are needed in place of the Chief Justice. If all 5(or 4 and 1 Chief Justice) Justices Agree, then the Legislative Branch Approvement is lowered to ½. If ¾ of the Legislative Branch Agrees, then the Justice Approvement is just a Chief Justice and two other Justices. If 100% of the Legislative Branch agrees, Then the Judicial Approvement is 2 Judges which include a Chief Justice (if there’s no Chief Justice, the Judicial Approvement must be at least ½ ) The Public cannot OVERRULE if they proposed an amendment change. However, if they get 92% approval, they can change the legislative branch's decision on the amendment. Finally, if the correct circumstances are met, the Amendment can be passed and be Placed in our Virtual Constitution.


  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>If the Legislative Branch Proposed, the Amendment is to be approved by the Executive and the Judicial Branch. The Executive Branch needs the President, the Vice President’s and at least 1 cabinet member’s Approval and the Judicial Branch needs the Chief Justice(If one is in office) and 2 other judges to approve of this Amendment. If there is no Chief Justice in office, then all of the remaining Justices must approve. If there is a Chief Justice in office, then there must be 2 Judges that Agree with the Chief Justice. If 4 out of the 5 people in the Executive Branch Agree (including the President), then the Approvement needs drops for the Judicial Branch to ⅗ (OR 1 Chief Justice and 1 other Justice). If the entire Executive Branch Agrees, then the approval needed drops to ⅖(1 chief Justice or 2 Justices). If all the Judges approve of this amendment(if there is a chief Justice in office, it must be ⅘ Justices, one must include the Chief Justice), the Executive Approvement drops to ½ (which must include the President, and if it doesn’t then the entire Cabinet and the Vice President must approve), and with 1 Chief Justice, and 4 other Justices, Executive Approvement drops to ¼(which also must include the President), if they get 100% Vote. Finally, if the correct circumstances are met, the Amendment can be passed and be Placed in our Virtual Constitution.


  <h4>Section 5</h4>

  <p>All the Amendments will be included at the bottom of this constitution. Also, Amendments that elaborate more on a particular part of the Constitution can be written on the actual document by the President in brackets.

<hr />

  <h3>Article VI</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>

  <p>If a person of any position in the government resigns, is impeached, put on a probabionary period or simply is incapacitated (unable to vote), then here are the steps of what will happen in the government next (who takes the position).


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>President: Their position goes to their Vice President. If they are incapacitated for only a temporary period of time, then the Vice President only gets the posistion until the President can do their job again.


  <p>Vice President: Their position goes to the Head of the Cabinet. If they are incapacitated for only a temporary period of time, then the Head of the Cabinet only gets the posistion until the Vice President can do their job again. If it’s temporary, the Head of Cabinet can have both positions: both Head of Cabinet and Vice President.


  <p>Head of the Cabinet: The President gets to pick the next head of the cabinet from the general public. If no one wants the position in the public, or the President doesn’t want to pick anyone in the public, they can pick a secretary that they would want to promote to the position. If still no one wants the job, then a random secretary is chosen for the position. If both secretaries want the job, then a random one is chosen.


  <p>Secretaries (of state, of defense, etc.): If they resign, the President gets to pick new secretaries. These secretaries must be from the public. However, if no one from the public wants to take the position, the President can take secretaries from Congress but they must do both jobs. If many people want the job from Congress, a random person is chosen. If no one from the Public or Congress wants to be in the cabinet, then the President chooses if they want Ms. Arabachain to take the job, or if the President doesn’t want there to be anyone with that position. But that position can only be empty after no one wants the job from the public or Congress and the President doesn’t want Ms. Arabachain to take the job.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>Chief Justice: The President nominates a new justice from the public. Both the Legislative Branch and the Public must approve. If the Legislative Branch agrees with at least a 5/9 vote, the new justice can take the job. However, if the public disagrees with at least a ¾ vote, then the President has to nominate a new Justice. If no one wants the job from the public, then and only then can people from the other parts of the Supreme Court apply for the job. If many people from the Supreme Court, one is chosen randomly. If no one wants the job from the Supreme Court or the public, then people from Congress can be offered the job. If literally no one wants the job, then the position goes to Ms. Arabachian until the elections. If Ms. Arabachian already has a position in government, then a random Justice is picked for the job. See below what would happen to that open space.


  <p>Any other Justice: The President nominates a new justice from the public. If the Legislative Branch agrees with at least a ¾ vote, then the justice is accepted. 80% of the public has to disagree with the decision for the President to elect a new nominee. If no one wants the job from the Public, then people from Congress can be offered the job. If literally no one wants the job, then the position goes to Ms. Arabachian until the elections.


  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>Congressmen/Congresswomen: If a Congressman/Congresswoman resigns, then the public votes for a new Congressman/Congresswoman. If no one wants the job, then Ms. Arabachian takes the position. If Ms. Arabachian is already in Congress, then a random person is chosen.


  <p>However, if in the middle of a term, a member of Congress breaks a law or is accused of Treason, Felony and/or Breach of the Peace, and is proven guilty in the Supreme Court of 8Genial1, then they will be immediately removed from office and will be replaced in a slightly different way. The Public first is asked if they want to volunteer to be in that spot, and if a volunteer is found for the spot they will replace that member. If no members of the public volunteer, then a random person is picked. If there are many volunteers, then a random person is picked from those volunteers. The person removed from office will only be able to come back after a probationary period of 1 month. If the entire public is a probationary period, or if there are less than 10 people who are on the probationary period, then the public will be randomly selected to fulfill those (remaining) positions.


  <p>Therefore, a person from Congress can be replaced 2 different ways, depending on how they went out of Office.

  <p>Finally, a President that has resigned can run again. Also, the people who the President wants to be in the Cabinet can run for Congress, but if they become a Cabinet member, and get elected to Congress, they must take the position in the Cabinet, and their Congress position will go to a random member of the public. The same thing would go for Supreme Court Nominees.

<hr />

  <h3>Article VII</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>

  <p>Impeachment can be for a number of reasons. They may want a person in office to be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Judges and the President can be impeached. However, members of Congress or members of the President’s Cabinet may not be impeached.


  <p>The President cannot remove their Vice President that they had chosen. However, if the Vice President commits a crime, and is put on a probationary period, then the laws in Article VI will be followed. The President also cannot remove a person in their cabinet during the middle of a term - however, they can switch cabinet members between their terms. The President cannot switch Vice Presidents between terms. Vice Presidents can be a Vice President for as many as a max of 5 months if they are chosen to.


  <p>The President/Justice who is being impeached must be at their own trial, and must defend themselves with either a lawyer, or with their own mouth.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>To start the impeachment process for a President, Congress needs at least a ½ vote, or needs an 80% vote from the Public. Then the President goes to an impeachment trial in Congress, where the President is questioned for up to 2 days. If someone asks an irrelevant question, or leads the witness, an objection can be called.


  <p>After, Congress votes on whether the person should remain in office. At least 6 people in Congress (without the Vice President Tiebreaker) must agree that the person should be taken out of office. If Congress doesn’t agree, then the vote stops. However if Congress does agree, the vote is passed down to the public. If 65% or more of the public agrees with Congress’s decision, then the President is taken out of office.


  <p>If the President is taken out of office, they would be put on a Probationary Period from any position in government for at least the length of 3 presidential terms. Then, the Vice President would take over the job, look to Article VI, Section 2 for more information on this.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>In the Judicial Branch, the Chief Justice and the other Justices can be impeached. Here’s how:


  <p>For the Chief Justice to be impeached, the impeachment process could start from either the public, or Congress. For it to be started by the public, 80% of the vote is needed, and if Congress starts it, then at least 7/10 people need to agree. Then the Chief Justice goes to an impeachment trial in Congress, where they are questioned for up to 2 days. If someone asks an irrelevant question, or leads the witness, an objection can be called.


  <p>After, Congress votes on whether the person should remain in office. At least 6 people in Congress (without the Vice President Tiebreaker) must agree that the person should be taken out of office. If the person is taken out of office, see Article VI Section 3 for more information.


  <p>If a Justice is to be impeached, the impeachment process can only start from the public, with a 75% vote.  Then the Chief Justice goes to an impeachment trial in Congress, where they are questioned for up to 2 days. If someone asks an irrelevant question, or leads the witness, an objection can be called.


  <p>Finally, Congress votes on whether that Justice should remain in the Supreme Court. If half or more agree that the Justice should be removed from office, then the Justice is removed from office. If not, then that doesn’t happen.


  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>Impeachment trials will happen only on Thursdays and Fridays, therefore limiting the amount of times a certain group can perform impeachments.


  <p>A remainder will be set here to remind everyone that they must be respectful during all trials and debates. There will not be any punishments in this constitution for disrespect during debates and trials for the fear of loopholes, but regardless, everyone must use their common sense by doing the three things listed below during debates (presidential and in class debates) as well as trials.

  <ol>
   <li>One person should talk at a time (i.e. everyone else should be muted when another person is talking, which will also help minimize background noises.)</li>

   <li>No one else may talk until the person who was talking has muted themselves.</li>

   <li>No one should monopolize the discussion. If someone is dying to speak, then they can raise their virtual hand in Zoom by clicking on the participants button (at the bottom middle of the screen), and clicking raise hand. If you have been talking for a while (you must use your own judgement), then look to see who has their hand raised, and ask them if they want to add on.</li>
  </ol>


  <h4>Section 5</h4>

  <p>Impeachment trials will work this way:


  <p>First, Congress will decide the day of the debate by a vote. It will do this on it’s weekly sessions on Fridays. Then, it will tell the people when that date is so that each side has time to prepare. Impeachment trials can only start on Thursdays or Fridays. They can be up to two full days long, but should not be more than one day.


  <p>Using the rules of debating, each side will present their argument without interruption or objections from either side. This should happen for 5 minutes at most, but can be deemed longer if there are an appreciatively great number of accusations to make. However, this part should not be more than 10 minutes at most.


  <p>After comes the questioning part of the impeachment trial. This is where the witnesses talk. They each will have 2 minutes to tell of their experiences, but it cannot be shorter than 30 seconds. Then the person who is being impeached has to say this: “I Swear (or promise) to Tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth So Help Me God.” If they are found to be lying, then it will be immediate impeachment.


  <p>The first questions should be just yes or no, e.g., were you on the bus at 3pm that afternoon. Then the next questions can come in, which will be short answer questions, e.g. at what bus stop did you get off at. This is how most of the questions should be. However, the person questioning can ask as many as 5 long answer questions e.g. explain the bus in as much detail as you can. None of these questions should take longer than 3 minutes to answer, for time management. ***Just a guide, not a law

  <h3>Article VIII</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>
  <p>Political parties will be incorporated into the government. Political Parties can be formed by anyone. The process is simple. Anyone who wants to create a political party needs to first come up with a name for their political party. Then, they need to get at least 4 other kids to join the party. For a party to exist, it must have at least 5 people in it.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>In a Political Party, in 8Genial1, there are 3 possible, but not necessary positions: The Party Chairperson, the Party Whip, and the Party Organizer. The Party Chairperson is the person at the top of the party. They are incharge of anything that goes on in the party. One term for them is 2 months, and they can have up to two terms. The Party Whip is the person in the party that is making sure that the party is on the same page. One term for them is 1 month, and they can have up to 3 terms. The Party Organizer is the person who organizes monthly meetings for the party. One term for them is 1 month, and they can have up to 4 terms. All of them are elected by anyone who associates themselves with the party. Political party positions do not count as government positions, so anyone with a Political Party position will be counted as the public for political matters.


  <h4>Section 3</h4>

  <p>Since there will be political parties, if multiple candidates are in one party, there will be a primary for that party. People in that party are the only people who can vote for the Primary Election. Teachers can join parties as well. The Primary election will be also done using a Google Form, where candidates can put information about themselves, their slogan, what they will do in office, and/or a poster saying all of that.


  <p>Even if a person is in a certain political party, for the final election, they can vote for someone in a different party if they want to. Political Parties will show up on the ballot. If someone is not in any political party, then they don’t get to vote in any primary elections, but they will be able to vote for the final election. If someone is running for any government position, they must state their party affiliation.


  <h4>Section 4</h4>

  <p>Here are some current Political Parties (work in progress): Alumni Liberum, People’s Party and Democratic-Republican.

<hr />

  <h3>Article IX</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>


  <p>Everyone will have the right to be in the government at least once during the school year even if they are not voted in.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>This right (the 8th Right in the Bill of Rights) is a very important right. Here is the way it works:


  <p>At the end of the school year (last presidential election), if someone has never been in the government, in any of the at least twenty positions that there are, they can request to have a position. The person cannot ask for a certain position that they want in particular, but they will be guaranteed a position. The positions that they cannot get are being a President (only can get by being voted in), Vice President, and a Chief Justice. However they can get Cabinet positions, Political Party positions, Justice Positions, and Congress Positions. They will get a random position.


  <p>If someone is already in the position, they can serve ten more days, and then are replaced by the person who has never had a position in government before. That person can serve until the rest of the year.

<hr />

  <h3>Article X</h3>
  <h4>Section 1</h4>

  <p>Citizens of the Class of 8Genial1 are given the rights and powers that are given in this Constitution to them. However, if one is not a Citizen of the Class of 8Genial1, they do not have those rights given to them in the Bill of Rights and are not able to run for positions in this government.


  <h4>Section 2</h4>

  <p>There are multiple ways that someone could be proclaimed a Citizen. If the person was assigned to the class of 8Genial1 for the year, then they are automatically a citizen. If the person was assigned late to our class, or switched to our class for the remainder of the year, then that person would automatically become a citizen. If the information if the person is assigned to our class is unclear (and the person is not a citizen yet), then if the person has been in the class for at least 6 days during the past 7 school days, ignoring sick days, then they are automatically proclaimed a citizen.


  <h4>Section 3<h4>

  <p>If someone left the class during the middle of the year, and won’t come back for the remainder of the school year, then they lose their citizenship. There is no other way for someone to lose their citizenship.</p>

  <h4>THIS CONSTITUTION CAN BE USED FOR THE 2021-2022 8G1</h4>

<hr />
