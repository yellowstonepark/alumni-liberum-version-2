      <h1 align="center">Mr. Otzar Jaffe - President</h1>
      <p class="textright">The main reason why I'm running for president is because I feel like I can make changes, good changes, that benefit both teachers and students. As your President, I would be the most determined Presdient that you had or will have. When I do something, I commit to it. Take this website for example. It could not have been done without learning at least 3 different programing languages, learning about the OS, learning about browsers -- which all take determination to do. So if you want a President that will get stuff done, and the stuff that they are doing is heavily based on your ideas and feedback, then I'm your guy.</p>

      <h1 align="center">The Vice President</h1>
      <p class="textright">The Vice President would have a very important job. The Vice President would speak to the public a lot. This person would communicate to me what they think needs to be changed in the classroom. They would also do various other tasks, important tasks. They would think of ideas for the classroom and help me with speeches, and other work. Although it sounds like it would be a lot of work, the Vice President won't have much work in terms of screen time because that would go against one of my beliefs that we need to not have excessive screen time. They would have no more than 25 minutes of work per week. I look forward to choosing a Vice President!</p>

      <h1 align="center">The Head Adivsor</h1>
      <p class="textright">My Head Adivsor would be a general advisor. By that I mean that they would advise me on many different topics, and not just a few specific ones. This job would be very important. This person would also listen to the public, and advise me on making certain decisions that would affect them. Therefore, the job of a head advisor would be very important. They would pretty much be speaking for the public's interest. Overall, a head advisor would advise me on various tasks and advise me on certain decisions. I look forward to picking my head advisor!</p>

      <h1 align="center">Secretary of Defense and Foreign Affairs</h1>
      <p class="textright">When I become President, if I ever get elected, I would need a person to advise me on foreign affairs. It is very important to have good relations with other nations, so that we can have a mutual relationship. It would be unreasonable to start a war with another nation, and would be a giant waste of time. One of my goals as President is to make sure that we have a good relationship with other countries, which can be useful to many reasons such as: creating study guides that we can share between classes, teaming up on unfair policies set up by teachers, and so many various other things that can improve our country and theirs at the same time. </p>

      <h1 align="center">Secretary of Homework, Essay, and Test Mangagement</h1>
      <p class="textright">One of the most controversial topics in many classes is the amount of homework, essays, and tests we should get during this time, when many students are stuggling to keep up with the workload, but when students need to learn as well. It is important to have someone in this position that understands that we go through. It is hard to have a balance between the amount of homework we should have (and homework helps us learn) and the amount of homework we shouldn't be having because it would be too much. The Secretary of Homework, Essay, and Test Mangagement will also advise me on tests, and the amount of classwork we should have.</p>
