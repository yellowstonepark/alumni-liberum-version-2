        <h2>What is a Radical in Politics?</h2>
        <p>A radical in politics (there are many types) is someone who does whatever it takes to get things done that they feel need to be done right away. In history, a radical during the civil war would be willing to kill and murder other people to end slavery. However, in the past 150 years, the definition has changed to just someone who wants change fast. For example, a radical today that wanted to end climate change would take drastic measures to do whatever it takes to put an end to fossil fuels and pollution. That would be an extreme radical, but there are many different levels of radicals. When someone in the politics talks about radicals, they usually talk about radicals like they are criminals, just in reality, radicals are not crazy people, they are just people who want change and who want that change fast.</p>

      <div id="Moderates">
        <h2>What is a Moderate in Politics?</h2>
        <p>A moderate in politics is someone who is willing to wait for change to happen, and a person that will go slow in achieving their goals. If we go back to the civil war example, slavery was something that many people wanted to abolish. However, instead of being like a radical, wanting change now and fast, moderates were willing to do things slowly, to slowly abolish it. The radicals were okay with starting a war, but the moderates were willing to wait and take as long as it was necessary to end slavery. There are different levels of moderates, some will be willing to take longer to achieve goals than other ones. Moderates are more liked, because people like slow change, rather than extreme and fast change. People also can be a radical when it come to one issue, and not be a radical when it comes to another issue. Moderates are more liked in general because people like slow change.</p>

        <h2>So are we Moderates or Radicals?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="which2one">
        <h2>We are a combination of both!</h2>
        <p>In certain areas, we will be more like radicals on, moving quickly and efficently to get the task done. However, we will make mostly slow change on things that we think shouldn't be rushed. For example, if every teacher was taking the full class to teach, we would slowly try to reduce the screentime in a number of tactics.</p>
        <p>We understand that certain things take time to accomplish, which is why we will not rush it. That's why I have an entire month in office, to accomplish our goals over time. So on many things, I will be more like a moderate, not more like a radical.</p>
        <p>However, some issues I believe that we need to solve right away. On these issues, I will be more like a radical on. For example, when I come into office, I will implent my participation plans, and my ideas for whether we should have to keep our camera on or off (read more about it <a href=" our-goals.html">here</a>) because I feel like we are in dire need of a system that works for everybody.</p>
